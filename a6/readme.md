### Cult recruitment

These simulations look at how neutral cells are gradually converted to cults by a few true believers. Cults are notoriously good at recruiting new members, and once members are initiated it is incredibly hard to get them out of the cults. This simulation is meant to argue that the key to preventing the take-over of cults is by having the ability to convince true believers, otherwise the cult will stabilize with a number of true believers that will never leave.

There is obviously much more nuance to cult deprogramming than just coming into contact with a deprogrammer. It's a much longer and arduous process than the simulation portrays. Additionally, a more realistic depiction would be where a limited number of deprogrammers move around (rather than turning other cells into deprogrammers as well). Overall though, the simulation succeeds in demonstrating that if true believers can't be convinced, they will continue to spread their beliefs.
