**Tool 1: Fireworks (Boom)**

Using bezier curves, firework bursts are sporadically drawn at the mouse tip in
colors analogous to the hue on the color picker. When mouse is dragged slowly,
it creates a line of fireworks. When mouse is dragged more quickly, separate
bursts are created.


**Tool 2: Sparkles (Shimmer)**

This tool draws five sparkles in random positions within 60 pixels of the
mouse pointer. By using multiple ellipses with high lightness and a low alpha
value, each sparkle gives off the illusion of glowing. The center circle is
colored with hues analogous to the value of the color picker.


**Tool 3: Stars (Shine)**

This tool sporadically draws three stars in random positions within 40 pixels of
the mouse pointer. Each star is a randomized size. The stars are colors
analogous to the hue on the color picker and outlined in a white line.


**Tool 4: Neon (Glow)**

While the other tools are more randomized and particle based, this tool was
created to give the user a greater degree of control. The tool functions much
like a pen tool, creating a black pen line outlined in white that follows the
path of the mouse. For best effects, move the mouse faster to create a clearer
line and outline.


**Other notes:**

The tool currently in use is indicated by the text at the bottom of the page.

The color picker is a slider that goes from 1 to 360, used to select the hue value.
