# Fog Monster

### The Mask

This mask is a foggy monster mask. The face of the monster has a gaping mouth filled with sharp teeth, and bright glowing white eyes. The hands of the monster have dark palms and fingers pointed with sharp claws. The bones of the hand are darker making the skin appear translucent. The edges of the face and hands are feathered using alpha values to make it appear as though the monster is emerging from a foggy background.

### Inspiration

My initial inspiration came from the images of faces pressed against fogged up glass. I wanted to create a silhouette that conjured this sort of image. After speaking with Avi Sheehan in one of the conversations with theatre majors, I decided to collect photos for inspiration in making my mask. Some of the photos that I kept in mind during creation are listed here:

During the conversation, we also discussed how non-human figures can become before they cross the line into being too other. One thing mentioned was that the eyes are key in a viewer being able to connect to a figure. I wanted to keep eyes as a focal point of my mask, making them a bright white to make them appear to glow and be unseeing. I wanted another focal point to be the mouth, making it appear to be a deep void by making it a much darker shade than the rest of the monster.

The final major design choice I made was keeping the image in black and white shades. This makes the monster appear even more otherwordly and also helps to conjure the fog image I was intending.


### Sliders
- Claw Length: Controls the length of the figure's claws.
- Teeth Length: Controls the length of the figure's teeth - lowest value creates no teeth.
- Deep Eyes: Controls the contrast of the eye rings. Higher value makes the inner ring much darker, making it appear more deepset.
- Face Shade: Controls the shade of the middling skin tone of the figure.
- Background: Controls the shade of background (the halo adjusts as well).
