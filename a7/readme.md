### Birds of a Feather

This page generates cool and unique individual feathers! All are striped to some degree, but size, shape, color, and structure varies with the sliders. These sliders are described in more detail below.

### The sliders
1. Density - The density of the feather's barbs. The higher the value, the more barbs will be drawn along the feather's shaft, causing it to look increasingly solid.
2. Height - The height of the shaft of the feather. A higher value increases the height.
3. Bend - The extremeness of the bend of the feather's shaft. The lowest value results in an S-shaped bend, the highest results in a Z-shaped bend, and the middle results in a straight feather.
4. Width - The length of the barbs. A higher width value makes the barbs longer, resulting in the feather having a wider appearance.
5. Hue 1 - The hue of one stripe color, colors the barbs. This is the more pastel stripe.
6. Hue 2 - The hue of the second stripe color, colors the barbs. This is the darker stripe.
7. Stripe Length - The length of each color's stripe. This determines how many barbs will be colored in each hue before it switches to the other. Minimum value is one (no solid colors allowed).
8. Fluff Variation - The amount of variation in length of the downy barbs. These are the fluffy white barbs at the base of the shaft. The higher the value, the longer some fluffs will be, resulting in more variation.
9. Fluff Number - The number of total downy barbs. Can be anywhere from none to 30.
