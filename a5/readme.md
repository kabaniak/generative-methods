### This bot is an airport help desk bot! Here to barely help at all with a smile.

There are three major input types, each with follow-up inputs that function as a very simplified finite state machine.

**Lost Luggage**
You can ask the bot to help you find your luggage. Typing any sentence including luggage into the input window (or pressing
the 'Find Luggage' button) will cause the bot to reply with the luggage they have behind their desk. It will then ask if you'd like to claim
what they found as yours. From there you can enter:
- Yes - you will have one bag added to the number that you are carrying.
- No - the bot will say that's too bad and say goodbye.

**Complaints**
You can make complaints to the help desk bot. First, type something like "I have a complaint" (be sure to include the word 'complain' in your
sentence), pressing the 'Generic Complaint' button serves the same purpose. This will cause the bot to prompt you for more details. From here you
can type literally anything you want. No matter the specific complaint, the bot will respond with an apology and some meager reward it can offer
you for your troubles.

**Change Flight**
You can change flights using the help desk bot. Typing any sentence including the word 'change' will trigger this response type. The bot will
describe an available flight to some location, along with a description of the place. It will then ask if you would like to book the flight.
From there you can enter:
- Yes - your current flight will be updated to the location. The bot will also tell you the inconvenient time that your flight leaves.
- No - the current flight will be unchanged and the bot will say goodbye.

**Other Input**
The bot will say it doesn't understand, but remind you to fly with their airline again!
